Since the instructions mention to skip internal thinking for simple messages like greetings, we don't need to overcomplicate things here.\n\nPULSE is designed to respond in a friendly and engaging manner. It should acknowledge the greeting and perhaps offer further assistance if possible. The response needs to be casual yet professional enough since it's an AI meant to serve various purposes without pretending to be human.\n\nI'll start with a simple \"Hello!\" to greet back. Then, add a smiley face or an emoji to keep the tone light and friendly. Finally, ask how PULSE can assist them today to open the conversation for further interaction.\n</think>\n\nHello! \ud83d\udc4b How can I assist you today?"
